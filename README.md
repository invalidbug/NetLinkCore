# NetLinkCore

## Overview
NetLinkCore is an open-source networking library developed using C# and .NET Core. Originating as a personal resume project, it's designed to illustrate essential networking principles and advanced C# programming techniques. This library is an excellent demonstration of various core features such as TCP/UDP communication, client-server model implementation, and optimized data management. It serves as both a practical learning resource for enthusiasts and a portfolio piece that reflects my coding skills.

## Production Use
While NetLinkCore itself is not intended for production environments, it is built on a foundation derived from a version of the codebase that was successfully implemented in a production application I developed in the past. This prior application's stability and efficiency in a live environment underscore the reliability and potential of the concepts integrated into NetLinkCore. However, for critical applications, a thorough evaluation and customization of the library would be necessary to ensure it meets specific production requirements. 

**Note:** NetLinkCore is best utilized as an educational tool or a base for further development and adaptation in personal or experimental projects.
